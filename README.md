## About

GregTech 6 CEu Modern is a modernized, community-driven continuation
of the ideas and mechanics introduced in **GregTech 6**,
adapted for modern Minecraft versions and modding APIs.

The goal of this project is to preserve the **design philosophy**
of GT6 (progression, realism, complexity),
while reimplementing it on top of modern Minecraft and NeoForge.
